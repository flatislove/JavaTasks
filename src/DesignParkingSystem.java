/**
 * Design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces: big, medium, and small,
 * with a fixed number of slots for each size.
 * Implement the ParkingSystem class:
 * ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) Initializes object of the ParkingSystem class. The number of slots
 * for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.
 * bool addCar(int carType) Checks whether there is a parking space of carType for the car that wants to get into
 * the parking lot. carType can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which are represented by 1, 2, and 3
 * respectively. A car can only park in a parking space of its carType. If there is no space available, return false,
 * else park the car in that size space and return true.
